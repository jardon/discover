## Building

## Vendor Customization

Want to change the apps featured in the Editor's Choice section? Add a configuration file named `/usr/share/discover/featuredurlrc` that points to a JSON file patterned off the default one present at https://autoconfig.kde.org/discover/featured-5.9.json:
```toml

```
